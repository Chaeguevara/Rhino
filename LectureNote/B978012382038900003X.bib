abstract = {With the basic understanding of geometric modeling, we are moving closer to the core of product design modeling—that is, solid modeling, especially feature-based parametric solid modeling, which is the key topic to be discussed in this chapter. In recent decades, the term solid modeling has been associated with the technology of using computer-aided design (CAD) systems to create the shape and form of part geometry and associated physical properties with a computer for the purpose of engineering designs. Today, CAD models with built-in essential product design information play a central role in e-Design. The objectives of this chapter are (1) to provide an introduction to the basic solid modeling theories that help readers understand how the product design is realized in CAD, and (2) to help readers become familiar with the behind-the-scenes operations in CAD modeling so as to effectively use these tools for design. We also provide a short discussion on commercial CAD software tools, with the hope of offering readers guidance on selecting proper tools that are suitable for their specific needs.}
